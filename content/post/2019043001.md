# Introduction

This article is a basic explanation of what is and how to create a Linux kernel module.

## The Linux Kernel and Kernel Modules

As we know the Linux kernel is an open-source, monolithic, soft preemptive UNIX like operating system partially compatible with POSIX specification. The Linux kernel is widely used in specific and general purpose applications.

The characteristic of being monolithic is relevant to this article. And shall be defined.

> A monolithic preemptive kernel runs all threads in the same virtual or physical address space. [^F2]

Imagine two procedures. In this case, I gonna explain using C code.

proc_a.ko

```c
static int a = 0;

void proc_a() {
    // ... do something with a
}
```

proc_b.ko

```c
extern int a;

void proc_b() {
    // ... do something with a
}
```

all the memory is shared between both procedures. That is, a global variable to both contexts gonna be visible by both procedures even if the procedures run in different threads. As in a single process, access control to the memory is necessary to work safely in the kernel space. That is, evenly if both procedures belong to different objects, the address of the variable ```a``` relatively to ```proc_a``` is going to be the same as the address of a relative to ```proc_b```.

That doesn't occur in processes. If we compile an executable image containing the variable ```a``` and compile another executable with the same variable. The variables are not going to share the same address space. This only occurs if we create a dynamically loaded code that is loaded by the same process at runtime.

A kernel module is a kernel runtime loadable binary object. The Linux kernel supports loading binary objects in the filesystem at runtime and a kernel module is the name of this binary object. As explained before the procedures in the binary object shares the same address space as all procedures in the kernel.

# Kernel Module In Practice

Kernel modules can be written in C programming language and basically have an entry function and a cleanup function. The ```init_module()``` function is the entry point and it is called when the module is loaded. The ```cleanup_module()``` function is the cleanup function and it is called when the module is unloaded.

```c
#include <linux/module.h>    /* Needed by all modules */
#include <linux/kernel.h>    /* Needed for KERN_INFO */

int init_module(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "Example Module Initialized\n");
    return 0;
}

void cleanup_module(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "Example Module Cleaned\n");
}
```

## Building a Kernel Module

To make the process easier, I created a repository as an entry point to a kernel module project. and it is available at http://git.afarias.org/arthur/kernel-module-example.

The kernel source is available at ```src/kernel-module-example-base.c``` the kernel module can be built by issuing following command ```make```. It can be installed by issuing ```sudo make modules_install && sudo depmod``` command.

The module can be loaded by issuing ```modprobe kernel-module-example``` and can be removed by ```modprobe -rf kernel-module-example```.

# DKMS

As Arch Linux community defines

> Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) is a program/framework that enables generating Linux kernel modules whose sources generally reside outside the kernel source tree. The concept is to have DKMS modules automatically rebuilt when a new kernel is installed. [^F1]
