# What is V4L2

Before start digging V4L2 API we should understand what is this platform and how to use it properly. The V4L2 API is a Linux Kernel API to support realtime video capture. There are too many device drivers built on top of this API and a lot of libraries and applications that communicates with the exposed interfaces to the user's space.

Next session will walthrough the interaction process between V4L2 user's space and kernel interfaces in detail. The purpose of this approach is to understand the structure of the V4L2 system in order to gain knowledge to understand the a V4L2 device driver.
