And Jesus ansered: "Man shall not live on bread alone". When digging the forest of C++ STL, I found something that is too nerd to not be reshared. This is a middle earth like map of C++ algorithm world.

This map was made by Jonathan Boccara, this guy has a [page](http://www.fluentcpp.com) in which a lot of good stuff is available to read about C++. And I would recommend if, like me, you are studying some new fetures of C++ stantard template library.
