And Jesus answered: “Man shall not live on bread alone”. When digging the forest of C++ STL, I found something that is too nerd to not be reshared (I laughed when I saw it). A map of C++ algorithms.

The map was made by Jonathan Boccara, this guy has a [page](https://www.fluentcpp.com/getthemap/) in which a lot of good stuff is available to read about C++. And I would recommend if, like me, you are studying some new features of C++ standard template library.
