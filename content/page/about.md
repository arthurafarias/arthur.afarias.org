# Carrer Profile

I am a Brazilian Bachelor in Electrical Engineering currently living in Spain. My career profile is based on a strong background in electronics and embedded software. Feel free to contact me by phone in [Brazil](tel:+5581986409601) or [Spain](tel:+34651318519) or by [e-mail](mailto:arthur@afarias.org). I also have a slack channel.

# Experiences

Versatility in the development of electronic and embedded systems were the main goals of experience during my career but I also have experience in scientific instrument maintenance.

## C/C++ programming

In 2019 I've contributed in an Open Source project called Pistache available at http://pistache.io. A complete STL C++11 REST framework for Linux systems. In this project, I've solved some memory leaks and some minor issues in the project structure.

## Schematic Capture and PCB Design

I have strong knowledge in tools like Autodesk Eagle and Labcenter Electronics Proteus besides of know how to design mixed-signal and medium-frequency circuit-boards.

## Linux Device Drivers

In 2018 I worked in Federal University of Campina Grande modifying V4L2 Linux drivers to add support to ADV7604 in a custom i.MX6 platform.

## Computer Vision Systems using OpenCV

In 2018 I was responsible to investigate the application of OpenCV algorithms as SIFT, SURF and FAST in several projects to Federal University of Campina Grande C++. The main goal of my bachelor's project was a performance comparison between the methods in a quad-core ARMv7 platform.

## IOT Development

My experience in IOT systems is mainly focused on MQTT and MQTTs over TCP/IP connection using WiFi using Expressif ESP-12e.

In 2017 I ported the RFM95 Lora Radio Transceiver driver to Texas Instruments TM4C123GXL ARM Cortex M microcontroller. The driver was written in C.

## IP Core design

Contributed designing a proof of concept parity check port using FPGA, validation using Verilator.

## Matlab Toolbox Development

In 2015, associated with Radiometria Research Group of UFCG, build a toolbox for simulating electromagnetic fields using Wave Concept Iterative Method.
