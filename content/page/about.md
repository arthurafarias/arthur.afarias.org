# Carrer Profile

Currently finishing Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at [Universidade Federal de Campina Grande](http://ufcg.edu.br/), Brazil. Mainly directed to development of embedded systems both hardware and software approaches.

# Experiences

Versatility in development os electronic and embedded systems are the main goals of experience during my carrer.

## Computer Vision Systems using OpenCV and C++

My current development activities are mainly focused on feature extraction and classification using OpenCV and C++. Algorithms as SIFT, SURF and FAST are being currently studied to objet recognition applications.

## IOT Development

My experience in IOT systems are mainly focused in MQTT and MQTTs over TCP/IP connection using WiFi using Expressif ESP-12e.

## IP Core desing

Contributed designing a proof of concept parity check port using FPGA, validation using Verilator.

## Matlab Toolbox Development

In 2015, associated with Radiometria Research Group of UFCG, build a toolbox for simulating electromagnetic fields using Wave Concept Iterative Method.
