OpenCV is an Open Source Computer Vision Library released under BSD license and can be used to academic and commercial use. It has various languages interfaces that supports multiple operating systems[^F1]. Multiple computer vision algorithms are implemented in OpenCV and it is being actively being developed by a very large comunity [^F1]. Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.

# Docker

Docker is a platform promoted by Docker, Inc. that provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-systems-level virtualization on Windows and Linux. The platform uses the resource isolation features from Linux Kernel that allows independent linux instances run independently without maitaining a virtual machine. [^F2]

# Motivation

Using Docker to develop and test OpenCV applications could be straightfoward in order to isolate libraries and dependencies from an application being tested. The definition of the container image is available at https://github.com/arthurafarias/docker-opencv

Next posts will show how to use this image to deploy and test your application written with OpenCV.
